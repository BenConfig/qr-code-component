### What I learned

I learned how to apply a CSS-only tilt effect on the card when hovering over it. The movement is a little jerky, but I was not able to find a JavaScript tutorial explaining how to create a smoother tilt effect. Many tutorials made use of a library, but I felt I would not learn anything if I did this.
